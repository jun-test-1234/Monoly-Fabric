Welcome to Monoly-Fabric's documentation!
===================================

**Monoly** is the enterprise trust network that enables both internal as well as external entities 
to communicate and collaborate with each other while retaining the *complete ownership* and *control* of their data.

Unlike most of the existing enterprise communication solutions where user data is stored in a centralized service, 
Monoly does not get involved in the enterprise userâ€™s data exchange loop while powering up the entire service trustworthy. 
Rather it defines the trust governance framework which enables secure peer to peer communication between trusted enterprise nodes.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
