Welcome to Monoly Fabric's documentation!
===================================

**Monoly Fabric** is an enterprise-grade trust network that enables both internal and external entities 
to communicate and collaborate with each other while retaining the *complete ownership* and *control* of their data.
It provides RESTFul Open APIs to integrate the Monoly technology into an existing or a new product (be it enterprise or cloud based).

Unlike most of the existing enterprise communication solutions where user data is stored in a centralized service, 
Monoly Fabric does not get involved in the enterprise usersâ€™ data exchange loop while powering up the entire service trustworthy. 
It defines the trust governance framework which enables secure peer to peer communication between trusted enterprise nodes.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`testing <installation>` the project.
